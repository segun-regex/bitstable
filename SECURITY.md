### Critical Vulnerabilities

For extremely sensitive security issues, encrypt your report using our PGP key (available upon request).

## Security Measures

### Smart Contract Security

1. **Access Control**

   - Role-based access control for administrative functions
   - Strict validation of caller permissions
   - Separation of concerns between user and admin functions

2. **Price Oracle Security**

   - Multiple authorized oracles required
   - Price validation bounds
   - Timestamp checking for price freshness

3. **Vault Security**

   - Minimum collateral ratio enforcement
   - Liquidation ratio monitoring
   - Debt ceiling limitations

4. **System Parameters**
   - Bounded parameter ranges
   - Multi-step parameter update process
   - Emergency shutdown capability

### Known Security Considerations

1. **Oracle Manipulation**

   - Price feed manipulation risk
   - Mitigation through multiple oracle sources
   - Price validity checks

2. **Liquidation Gaming**

   - Front-running liquidations
   - Liquidation incentive balancing
   - Gradual liquidation mechanisms

3. **Smart Contract Risks**
   - Reentrancy attacks
   - Integer overflow/underflow
   - Logic errors in collateral calculations

## Security Best Practices
